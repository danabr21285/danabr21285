## 💼 Featured Projects

### 🏦 [Banking Database Project](https://github.com/danabr21285/banking-database-project)
Practice database project written in SQL for a fictional banking system. Includes DDL scripts for tables (branch, customer, account, loan, depositor, borrower), integrity constraints, and advanced query examples using subqueries, joins, `EXCEPT`, and aggregate functions.

### 🌦️ [Daily Weather Logger with Prefect](https://github.com/danabr21285/prefectdatacleaningproject)  
A simple ETL pipeline built with Python and [Prefect](https://www.prefect.io/) to fetch daily weather data from the WeatherAPI and log it to a CSV file. Demonstrates task orchestration, flow management, and external API usage.

### 🧠 [COMLEX Question Generator](https://github.com/danabr21285/comlex-question-generator)
AI-powered app that generates COMLEX-style practice questions and rationales for medical students. Built with Python, FastAPI, and OpenAI API.

### 📈 [Student Performance Analysis Using AI](https://github.com/danabr21285/student-performance-analysis-using-ai)  
Leverages GPT-4 and prompt engineering to uncover academic risk patterns among osteopathic medical students. Includes COMLEX failure prediction using logistic regression, performance thresholds, and data-driven academic intervention strategies.

### 📊 [FIRE Program Clustering Analysis](https://github.com/danabr21285/fire-program-clustering)
Used hierarchical clustering in R to identify learning patterns and support needs among students in the FIRE (prematriculation) program.

### 📊 [FIRE Program K-means Clustering](https://github.com/danabr21285/fire-kmeans-clustering)  
Unsupervised learning project using K-means clustering to group FIRE (prematricualtion) program students based on academic and testing indicators (MCAT, GPA, COMSAE, age). Includes normalization, elbow method, and cluster profile analysis.

### 📈 [Admissions Dashboard](https://github.com/danabr21285/admissions-dashboard)
Interactive Tableau dashboard that visualizes MCAT, GPA, geographic, and class composition data to support admissions committee decision-making.

### 🧬 [Event Attendance Clustering](https://github.com/danabr21285/event-clustering)  
Used hierarchical clustering in R to segment admissions event attendees (campus tours, open houses, etc.) by background characteristics (first-gen, URIM, HPSA). Identified 5 clusters to guide strategic outreach and improve engagement.

### 🧠 [Slate CRM AI-Powered School Assessment Dashboard](https://github.com/danabr21285/slate-crm-ai-powered-school-assessment-dashboard)
AI-enhanced Slate dashboard that scores and clusters schools based on applicant trends, quality indicators, and conversion potential.

### 🎯 [Prompt-Driven Scoring Logic with OpenAI](https://github.com/danabr21285/scoringlogicAI)
This project demonstrates how you can use the power of **OpenAI’s large language models** to generate structured, data-informed scoring rubrics from real-world tabular data. Built using 4 years of student admissions data from a graduate healthcare program, this approach is widely adaptable to any business looking to **understand customer behavior, prioritize leads, or guide strategic decisions** using transparent, explainable scoring.

### 📈 [Forecasting Medical School Applications Using R](https://github.com/danabr21285/scoringlogicAI)
This project applies a linear regression model to forecast application volume for a graduate medical school program across three campuses. Built using R, the model supports data-driven enrollment planning and demonstrates how simple time-based trends can be used for predictive insights in real-world scenarios.
